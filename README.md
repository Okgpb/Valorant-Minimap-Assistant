### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1.  For best performance, it is recommended to set your game's display mode to **Windowed Fullscreen**.
2.  This tool has built-in presets for **2560x1600** and **2560x1440** resolutions. If you use a different resolution, you **must** use the **Custom** option to define your minimap's coordinates manually.

### ‚ú® Features

* **Auto Detection**: No manual operation needed. The program automatically detects enemy symbol using real-time color and shape analysis on the minimap.
* **Blinking Overlay Alert**: Displays a clear, blinking red dot overlay at the exact location of the detected threat to grab your attention.
* **High Accuracy**: Uses a two-frame verification system to minimize false positives from random visual noise.
* **Configurable GUI**: An intuitive interface to adjust detection sensitivity, resolution presets, scan interval, and other settings.
* **Multi-resolution Support**: Includes presets for common resolutions and a "Custom" mode for any screen size.
* **Debug Mode**: An optional mode to view the live image analysis and see what the program is detecting in real-time.
